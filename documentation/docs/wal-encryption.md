# Configure WAL encryption

WAL encryption requires a principal key. You can satisfy this requirement in one of the following ways:

## Option 1: Use the default principal key

If a default principal key is already configured for the server, WAL encryption uses it automatically. No additional server key configuration is required.

If you have not yet configured a default principal key, see [Default Principal Key configuration](global-key-provider-configuration/set-principal-key.md).

## Option 2: Configure a dedicated server (principal) key for WAL

!!! note
    For a comprehensive list of supported `pg_tde` WAL encryption tools see [Limitations of pg_tde](index/tde-limitations.md).

1. Create the `pg_tde` extension if it does not exist:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_tde;
    ```

2. Configure a global key provider

    Before creating the server (principal) key for WAL encryption, you must first configure a global key provider. See [Key management overview](global-key-provider-configuration/overview.md) for detailed instructions on configuring supported key providers.

3. Create the server (principal) key using the global key provider

    The server key (also referred to as the principal key) is the key used by PostgreSQL to encrypt WAL data. See [pg_tde_create_key_using_global_key_provider](functions.md#pg_tde_create_key_using_global_key_provider) for  more detailed instructions.

4. Set the server (principal) key

    This step sets the previously created server (principal) key as the active key used by PostgreSQL for WAL encryption. See [pg_tde_set_server_key_using_global_key_provider](functions.md#pg_tde_set_server_key_using_global_key_provider) for  more detailed instructions.

5. Enable WAL encryption using the `ALTER SYSTEM` command. You need the privileges of the superuser to run this command:

    ```sql
    ALTER SYSTEM SET pg_tde.wal_encrypt = on;
    ```

6. Restart the server to apply the changes.

    * On Debian and Ubuntu:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart postgresql
    ```

    * On RHEL and derivatives

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart postgresql-<version>
    ```

7. (Optional) Verify that WAL encryption is enabled:

    ```sql
    SHOW pg_tde.wal_encrypt;
    ```

Now WAL files start to be encrypted for both encrypted and unencrypted tables.
