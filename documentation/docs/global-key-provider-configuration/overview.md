# Key management overview

In production environments, storing encryption keys locally on the PostgreSQL server can introduce security risks. To enhance security, `pg_tde` supports integration with external Key Management Systems (KMS) through a Global Key Provider interface.

This section describes how you can configure `pg_tde` to use the local and external key providers.
To use an external KMS with `pg_tde`, follow these two steps:

1. Configure a Key Provider
2. Set the [Global Principal Key](set-principal-key.md)

!!! note
     While key files may be acceptable for **local** or **testing environments**, KMS integration is the recommended approach for production deployments.

!!! warning
    Do not rotate encryption keys while `pg_basebackup` is running. Standbys or standalone clusters created from such backups may fail to start during WAL replay. Schedule rotations outside your backup windows and run a new full backup afterward.

`pg_tde` has been tested with the following key providers:
