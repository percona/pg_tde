# Set up `pg_tde`

## Enable extension

Load the `pg_tde` at the start time. The extension requires additional shared memory; therefore,  add the `pg_tde` value for the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter and restart the `postgresql` instance.

1. Use the [ALTER SYSTEM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altersystem.html) command from `psql` terminal to modify the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. This requires superuser privileges. 

    ```
    ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_tde';
    ```

2. Start or restart the `postgresql` instance to apply the changes.

    * On Debian and Ubuntu:    

       ```sh
       sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service
       ```
    
    * On RHEL and derivatives

       ```sh
       sudo systemctl restart postgresql-17
       ```

3. Create the extension using the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command. You must have the privileges of a superuser or a database owner to use this command. Connect to `psql` as a superuser for a database and run the following command:

    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_tde;
    ```
    
    By default, the `pg_tde` extension is created for the currently used database. To enable data encryption in other databases, you must explicitly run the `CREATE EXTENSION` command against them. 

    !!! tip

        You can have the `pg_tde` extension automatically enabled for every newly created database. Modify the template `template1` database as follows: 

        ```sh
        psql -d template1 -c 'CREATE EXTENSION pg_tde;'
        ```

## Key provider configuration

1. Set up a key provider for the database where you have enabled the extension.

    === "With KMIP server"

        Make sure you have obtained the root certificate for the KMIP server and the keypair for the client. The client key needs permissions to create / read keys on the server. Find the [configuration guidelines for the HashiCorp Vault Enterprise KMIP Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/enterprise/kmip-engine).
        
        For testing purposes, you can use the PyKMIP server which enables you to set up required certificates. To use a real KMIP server, make sure to obtain the valid certificates issued by the key management appliance. 

        ```
        SELECT pg_tde_add_key_provider_kmip('provider-name','kmip-IP', 5696, '/path_to/server_certificate.pem', '/path_to/client_key.pem');
        ```

        where:

        * `provider-name` is the name of the provider. You can specify any name, it's for you to identify the provider.
        * `kmip-IP` is the IP address of a domain name of the KMIP server
        * `port` is the port to communicate with the KMIP server. Typically used port is 5696.
        * `server-certificate` is the path to the certificate file for the KMIP server.
        * `client key` is the path to the client key.

        <i warning>:material-information: Warning:</i> This example is for testing purposes only:

        ```
        SELECT pg_tde_add_key_provider_kmip('kmip','127.0.0.1', 5696, '/tmp/server_certificate.pem', '/tmp/client_key_jane_doe.pem');
        ```

    === "With HashiCorp Vault"

        The Vault server setup is out of scope of this document.

        ```sql
        SELECT pg_tde_add_key_provider_vault_v2('provider-name','root_token','url','mount','ca_path');
        ``` 

        where: 

        * `url` is the URL of the Vault server
        * `mount` is the mount point where the keyring should store the keys
        * `root_token` is an access token with read and write access to the above mount point
        * [optional] `ca_path` is the path of the CA file used for SSL verification

        <i warning>:material-information: Warning:</i> This example is for testing purposes only:

	    ```
	    SELECT pg_tde_add_key_provider_file_vault_v2('my-vault','http://vault.vault.svc.cluster.local:8200,'secret/data','hvs.zPuyktykA...example...ewUEnIRVaKoBzs2', NULL);
	    ```

    === "With a keyring file"

        This setup is intended for development and stores the keys unencrypted in the specified data file.    

        ```sql
        SELECT pg_tde_add_key_provider_file('provider-name','/path/to/the/keyring/data.file');
        ```

	    <i warning>:material-information: Warning:</i> This example is for testing purposes only:

	    ```sql
	    SELECT pg_tde_add_key_provider_file('file-keyring','/tmp/pg_tde_test_local_keyring.per');
	    ```
       
       
2. Add a principal key

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_tde_set_principal_key('name-of-the-principal-key', 'provider-name');
    ```

    <i warning>:material-information: Warning:</i> This example is for testing purposes only:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_tde_set_principal_key('test-db-master-key','file-vault');
    ```

    The key is auto-generated.


   <i info>:material-information: Info:</i> The key provider configuration is stored in the database catalog in an unencrypted table. See [how to use external reference to parameters](external-parameters.md) to add an extra security layer to your setup.


## WAL encryption configuration (tech preview)

After you [enabled `pg_tde`](#enable-extension) and started the Percona Server for PostgreSQL, a principal key and a keyring for WAL are created. Now you need to instruct `pg_tde ` to encrypt WAL files by configuring WAL encryption. 

Here's how to do it:

1. Enable WAL level encryption using the `ALTER SYSTEM SET` command. You need the privileges of the superuser to run this command:

    ```sql
    ALTER SYSTEM set pg_tde.wal_encrypt = on;
    ```

2. Restart the server to apply the changes.

    * On Debian and Ubuntu:    

       ```sh
       sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service
       ```
    
    * On RHEL and derivatives

       ```sh
       sudo systemctl restart postgresql-17
       ```

3. We highly recommend you to create your own keyring and rotate the principal key. This is because the default principal key is created from the local keyfile and is stored unencrypted. 

    Set up the key provider for WAL encryption

    === "With HashiCorp Vault"
    
        ```sql
        SELECT pg_tde_add_key_provider_vault_v2('PG_TDE_GLOBAL','provider-name',:'secret_token','url','mount','ca_path');
        ``` 

        where: 

        * `PG_TDE_GLOBAL` is the constant that defines the WAL encryption key  
        * `provider-name` is the name you define for the key provider
        * `url` is the URL of the Vault server
        * `mount` is the mount point where the keyring should store the keys
        * `secret_token` is an access token with read and write access to the above mount point
        * [optional] `ca_path` is the path of the CA file used for SSL verification


    === "With keyring file"

        This setup is intended for development and stores the keys unencrypted in the specified data file.    

        ```sql
        SELECT pg_tde_add_key_provider_file('provider-name','/path/to/the/keyring/data.file');
        ```

4. Rotate the principal key. Don't forget to specify the `PG_TDE_GLOBAL` constant to rotate only the principal key for WAL.

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_tde_rotate_principal_key('PG_TDE_GLOBAL', 'new-principal-key', 'provider-name');
    ```

Now all WAL files are encrypted for both encrypted and unencrypted tables.
