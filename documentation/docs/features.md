# Features

We provide `pg_tde` in two versions for both PostgreSQL Community and [Percona Server for PostgreSQL](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/17/). The difference between the versions is in the set of included features which in its turn depends on the Storage Manager API. While PostgreSQL Community uses the default Storage Manager API, Percona Server for PostgreSQL extends the Storage Manager API enabling to integrate custom storage managers.

The following table provides features available for each version:
